            <h1 id="policy">CoinVault: Privacy Policy</h1>


            <h3>CoinVault (Wallet/Website/Extension)</h3>

            <p>When you use decentralized identifiers, you can choose to publish and make your identifiers and profiles attached to those identifiers,
              available to the public.</p>
